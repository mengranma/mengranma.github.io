### A brief introductory landing page

Having been devoting myself to professional studies and research projects of biochemistry, applied statistics, and biological sciences at Purdue University, I have substantially enhanced my intellectual interest and sharpened my competence in biostatistics. To become an exceptional researcher in the field of statistical genetics, I strive to pursue the most advanced education in your quality MS in Biostatistics at Columbia University and pursue the statistical genetics track, since I do consider myself as a well-qualified candidate with proven intellectual capacity, stalwart academic background, substantive professional experience, and a highly motivated spirit.
